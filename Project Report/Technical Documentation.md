# 🌱 EcoPackAI – AI-Powered Sustainable Packaging Recommendation System

EcoPackAI is an AI-driven web application that recommends **sustainable and cost-efficient packaging materials** based on product requirements. The system leverages machine learning, cloud databases, and business intelligence dashboards to support **environmentally responsible and data-driven packaging decisions**.

---

## 1️⃣ Problem Statement

Choosing eco-friendly packaging materials is challenging due to the need to balance:

* Environmental impact (CO₂ emissions, biodegradability)
* Cost efficiency
* Material performance and durability

Traditional selection methods are manual, subjective, and inefficient. Poor packaging choices can increase costs and environmental damage. **EcoPackAI solves this problem by providing an AI-based recommendation system** that objectively evaluates packaging materials using data-driven intelligence.

---

## 2️⃣ Objectives

* Recommend eco-friendly packaging materials using AI
* Reduce environmental impact and CO₂ emissions
* Optimize packaging cost and material usage
* Provide actionable insights through dashboards and APIs

---

## 3️⃣ Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

**Backend**

* Python
* Flask

**Database**

* PostgreSQL (Cloud)

**Machine Learning**

* Random Forest
* XGBoost

**Deployment**

* Render / Heroku

**Tools**

* GitHub
* VS Code

---

## 4️⃣ System Architecture

**Flow:**

User → Web UI → Flask REST API → ML Models → PostgreSQL Database → Recommendation Response

The system follows a modular architecture where data storage, AI prediction, backend logic, and frontend presentation are decoupled for scalability and maintainability.
